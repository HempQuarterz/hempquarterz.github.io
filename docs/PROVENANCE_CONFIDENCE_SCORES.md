## What is Provenance Confidence?

**Provenance confidence** is All4Yah's transparent **scholarly credibility score** (0.0-1.0 scale) indicating how reliably we can trace a biblical book back to its claimed historical origins.

### Why Provenance Matters

Not all ancient manuscripts are equally reliable. Some books have:
- ✅ **Extensive manuscript evidence** (hundreds of ancient copies)
- ✅ **Early attestation** (written within decades of events)
- ✅ **Textual stability** (minimal variants between manuscripts)
- ✅ **Archaeological support** (Dead Sea Scrolls, papyri fragments)

Others have:
- ⚠️ **Limited manuscripts** (few surviving copies)
- ⚠️ **Late attestation** (written centuries after claimed events)
- ⚠️ **Textual variants** (significant differences between manuscripts)
- ⚠️ **No archaeological confirmation** (no fragments from claimed era)

**All4Yah's provenance scores** help you understand these differences transparently.

---

## Scoring Methodology

Provenance confidence is calculated using **5 weighted factors**, each contributing to the final score (0.0-1.0):

### 1. Manuscript Age and Quantity (Weight: 30%)

**Formula:**
```
age_score = (ancient_manuscript_count × manuscript_age_factor) / max_possible_score
```

**Factors:**
- **More ancient manuscripts** = higher score
- **More manuscript copies** = higher score
- **Geographic distribution** = higher score (manuscripts from different regions reduce bias)

**Examples:**

| Book | Ancient MSS | Age of Oldest | Score |
|------|-------------|---------------|-------|
| **Isaiah** | 25+ (DSS) | 150 BCE | 0.95 |
| **Sirach** | 10+ (Genizah, DSS) | 100 BCE | 0.90 |
| **Gospel of Thomas** | 3 (Greek, Coptic) | 200 CE | 0.65 |

---

### 2. Textual Stability (Weight: 25%)

**Formula:**
```
stability_score = 1 - (variant_density × severity_weight)
```

**Factors:**
- **Fewer textual variants** between manuscripts = higher score
- **Minor variants** (spelling, word order) = small penalty
- **Major variants** (entire verses added/omitted) = large penalty

**Variant Types:**
1. **Orthographic** (spelling): Minimal impact
2. **Grammatical** (word order): Small impact
3. **Lexical** (word choice): Moderate impact
4. **Theological** (doctrinal changes): Large impact

**Examples:**

| Book | Variant Density | Severity | Score |
|------|-----------------|----------|-------|
| **1 Peter** | 1.2% | Low | 0.94 |
| **1 Maccabees** | 2.8% | Low | 0.88 |
| **Gospel of Mary** | 15%+ | High | 0.55 |

---

### 3. Early Church Usage (Weight: 20%)

**Formula:**
```
usage_score = (church_father_citations + liturgical_usage + canonical_listings) / max_citations
```

**Factors:**
- **Quoted by church fathers** (1st-5th c. CE) = higher score
- **Used in liturgy** (worship services) = higher score
- **Listed in early canons** (councils, manuscripts) = higher score

**Church Father Citations (by century):**
- **1st century:** Clement of Rome, Ignatius of Antioch
- **2nd century:** Justin Martyr, Irenaeus, Clement of Alexandria
- **3rd century:** Origen, Tertullian, Cyprian
- **4th century:** Athanasius, Jerome, Augustine, Cyril

**Examples:**

| Book | Church Father Citations | Liturgical Use | Score |
|------|-------------------------|----------------|-------|
| **Psalms** | 400+ | Constant | 0.98 |
| **Wisdom of Solomon** | 80+ | Frequent | 0.87 |
| **2 Esdras** | 15 | Rare | 0.72 |

---

### 4. Archaeological Evidence (Weight: 15%)

**Formula:**
```
archaeology_score = (DSS_fragments + papyri_fragments + inscriptions) / max_evidence
```

**Factors:**
- **Dead Sea Scrolls fragments** = highest weight
- **Papyri fragments** (2nd-4th c. CE) = high weight
- **Archaeological inscriptions** = moderate weight
- **Carbon dating confirmation** = bonus

**Dead Sea Scrolls (DSS) Evidence:**
- **Every OT book** except Esther found at Qumran
- **Hebrew fragments** of Sirach, Tobit, Psalm 151
- **Dating:** 3rd c. BCE - 1st c. CE (carbon-14 confirmed)

**Examples:**

| Book | DSS Fragments | Papyri | Score |
|------|---------------|--------|-------|
| **Isaiah** | 25+ scrolls | 10+ | 0.96 |
| **Sirach** | 5 scrolls | 5+ | 0.91 |
| **Kebra Nagast** | 0 | 0 | 0.45 |

---

### 5. Scholarly Consensus (Weight: 10%)

**Formula:**
```
consensus_score = (academic_acceptance + peer_reviewed_research + critical_editions) / max_consensus
```

**Factors:**
- **Academic acceptance** (percentage of scholars affirming authenticity)
- **Peer-reviewed research** (publications on manuscript tradition)
- **Critical editions** (authoritative scholarly texts available)

**Scholarly Organizations:**
- Society of Biblical Literature (SBL)
- European Association of Biblical Studies (EABS)
- International Organization for Septuagint and Cognate Studies (IOSCS)
- Dead Sea Scrolls Foundation

**Examples:**

| Book | Academic Acceptance | Critical Editions | Score |
|------|---------------------|-------------------|-------|
| **Romans** | 99%+ | Nestle-Aland, UBS | 0.98 |
| **1 Maccabees** | 95% | Rahlfs LXX | 0.90 |
| **Gospel of Thomas** | 40% (as early text) | Critical editions exist | 0.62 |

## Manuscript Attestation

### What is Manuscript Attestation?

**Attestation** refers to the **ancient manuscript copies** that preserve a biblical book. More attestation = higher confidence.

### Major Manuscript Collections:

**1. Dead Sea Scrolls (DSS) - 3rd c. BCE - 1st c. CE**
- **Location:** Qumran caves near Dead Sea (Israel)
- **Discovery:** 1947-1956
- **Content:** 230+ biblical texts, including:
  - Every OT book except Esther
  - Hebrew fragments of Sirach, Tobit, Psalm 151
  - 1 Enoch (Aramaic), Jubilees (Hebrew)
- **Significance:** **Oldest Hebrew manuscripts** (1,000+ years older than Masoretic Text)

**2. Greek Papyri (P) - 2nd-4th c. CE**
- **Location:** Egypt (Oxyrhynchus, Herculaneum)
- **Content:** Early NT fragments
  - P52 (John 18, c. 125 CE - **oldest NT fragment**)
  - P46 (Paul's letters, c. 200 CE)
  - P75 (Luke, John, c. 200 CE)
- **Significance:** Confirms NT text within 30-100 years of composition

**3. Greek Uncials (Codices) - 4th-5th c. CE**
- **Codex Sinaiticus (א):** 4th c. CE, complete NT + LXX OT
- **Codex Vaticanus (B):** 4th c. CE, nearly complete Bible
- **Codex Alexandrinus (A):** 5th c. CE, complete Bible
- **Significance:** **Oldest complete Bibles**, include deuterocanonical books

**4. Latin Vulgate - 4th-5th c. CE**
- **Translation:** Jerome (382-405 CE), Hebrew + Greek → Latin
- **Content:** OT (Hebrew + deuterocanon) + NT
- **Manuscripts:** 8,000+ medieval copies
- **Significance:** Western church standard for 1,000+ years

**5. Syriac Peshitta - 2nd-5th c. CE**
- **Translation:** Hebrew/Greek → Syriac (Aramaic dialect)
- **Content:** OT + NT (some deuterocanon excluded)
- **Manuscripts:** 350+ ancient copies
- **Significance:** Eastern church standard, preserves early readings

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Q1: Why don't all books have 0.90+ scores?

**Answer:** Ancient manuscripts are rare. Most books don't have:
- Dead Sea Scrolls fragments (DSS only cover 3rd c. BCE - 1st c. CE)
- Papyri from the composition era (most papyri are 200-500 years later)
- Extensive early church citations (church fathers quoted some books more than others)

Even **excellent manuscripts** like Wisdom of Solomon (0.87) have gaps because:
- Composed in Greek (no Hebrew original to compare)
- No DSS fragments (likely composed after 100 BCE)
- Fewer manuscripts than Psalms or Isaiah

### Q2: Does a lower score mean a book isn't Scripture?

**Answer:** No. Provenance confidence ≠ divine inspiration.

**Low scores** can result from:
- **Lost manuscripts** (e.g., original Hebrew of Tobit lost, only Greek survives)
- **Later composition** (e.g., Wisdom of Solomon written c. 50 CE, no DSS)
- **Geographic isolation** (e.g., Ethiopian books preserved only in Ge'ez)

**Example:** 2 Esdras (0.75) is accepted as canonical by some Orthodox churches despite moderate provenance, because:
- Theological harmony with Orthodox tradition
- Liturgical use for centuries
- Accepted by council decisions

All4Yah provides the data; **you decide** based on your tradition.

### Q3: How often are provenance scores updated?

**Answer:** Scores are **reviewed annually** when:
- New manuscript discoveries occur (e.g., DSS fragments still being published)
- New critical editions released (e.g., SBL Greek NT updates)
- Peer-reviewed research changes scholarly consensus

**Recent updates:**
- Sirach: 0.92 → 0.95 (2020, new Masada scroll analysis)
- Psalm 151: 0.89 → 0.94 (2019, DSS 11Q5 full publication)

### Q4: Can users contest a provenance score?

**Answer:** Yes. All4Yah is committed to transparency.

**Process:**
1. Open a GitHub issue with:
   - Book name and current score
   - Manuscript evidence you believe was overlooked
   - Peer-reviewed sources supporting your case
2. All4Yah research team reviews within 30 days
3. If valid, score adjusted and changelog published

**Example:** If new DSS fragments are discovered, scores will be updated to reflect new evidence.

### Q5: Why use a numeric score instead of categories?

**Answer:** **Precision and transparency.**

- ❌ **Categories** ("High", "Medium", "Low") hide nuance
- ✅ **Numeric scores** (0.87 vs 0.84) show exact confidence levels

**Example:**
- Wisdom of Solomon (0.87) and Judith (0.88) are both "High"
- But Judith has slightly more manuscript evidence
- Numeric score shows this difference precisely

### Q6: How do provenance scores relate to canonical tiers?

**Answer:** They are **independent but correlated**.

**Canonical Tier** = Historical church acceptance
**Provenance Confidence** = Manuscript quality

**Examples:**
- **High provenance, Tier 1:** Isaiah (0.95, universally canonical)
- **High provenance, Tier 2:** Sirach (0.95, deuterocanonical)
- **Moderate provenance, Tier 2:** 2 Esdras (0.75, deuterocanonical in some traditions)
- **Fair provenance, Tier 3:** Gospel of Thomas (0.68, apocryphal/historical)

**Key Point:** A book can have **high provenance** but **not be canonical** (e.g., Gospel of Thomas has early manuscripts but is Gnostic).
