## What Are Canonical Tiers?

**Canonical tiers** are All4Yah's transparent classification system for organizing biblical books based on their **historical acceptance** across different Christian traditions.

Instead of arbitrarily including or excluding books, All4Yah presents the **full breadth of ancient biblical literature** with clear labels showing which books are:
- Universally accepted (Protestant, Catholic, Orthodox, Ethiopian)
- Accepted by some traditions but not others
- Historically significant but not canonical

This allows you to:
‚úÖ **Make informed decisions** based on your tradition
‚úÖ **Explore the full history** of biblical canon formation
‚úÖ **Study cross-references** between different tier books
‚úÖ **Understand manuscript provenance** with confidence scores

## Historical Context: How Canons Formed

Understanding **why** different Christian traditions have different canons is essential for studying Scripture transparently.

### Hebrew Bible (Tanakh) - Jewish Canon
**Formalized:** c. 90-100 CE (Council of Jamnia)
**Books:** 24 books (same content as Protestant 39 OT books, different arrangement)
**Sections:**
- **Torah** (Law): 5 books
- **Nevi'im** (Prophets): 8 books
- **Ketuvim** (Writings): 11 books

**Why 24 instead of 39?** Combined books (e.g., 1-2 Samuel as one book, 12 minor prophets as one book)

---

### Septuagint (LXX) - Greek Old Testament
**Translation:** 3rd-1st c. BCE (Hebrew ‚Üí Greek)
**Books:** Hebrew canon + deuterocanonical books
**Significance:**
- Used by Hellenistic Jews
- Quoted 300+ times in New Testament
- Standard Bible of early Christian church

**Key Point:** Jesus and the Apostles used the LXX, which included deuterocanonical books.

---

### Early Church Period (1st-4th c. CE)
**Councils:**
- **Council of Hippo (393 CE):** Affirmed 73-book canon (OT + deuterocanon + NT)
- **Council of Carthage (397 CE):** Confirmed Hippo's canon
- **Council of Carthage (419 CE):** Reaffirmed canon

**Result:** Western church (Catholic) used Vulgate translation with deuterocanon

---

### Reformation Period (16th c. CE)
**Protestant Position:**
- Martin Luther (1534): Deuterocanon as "Apocrypha" ‚Äî useful but not canonical
- Based on Hebrew Masoretic Text (MT) instead of Greek LXX
- 66-book canon (39 OT + 27 NT)

**Catholic Response:**
- Council of Trent (1546): Officially affirmed 73-book canon
- Declared deuterocanonical books inspired Scripture

---

### Orthodox Churches
**Canon:** 76-81 books (varies by tradition)
- Greek Orthodox: ~76 books
- Russian Orthodox: ~77 books
- Ethiopian Orthodox: **81 books** (broadest canon)

**Additions:**
- Psalm 151
- 3-4 Maccabees

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Q1: Is Tier 2 less inspired than Tier 1?

**Answer:** That depends on your theological tradition.

- **Catholic/Orthodox view:** Tier 2 books are **equally inspired Scripture**, affirmed by early church councils.
- **Protestant view:** Tier 2 books are **useful for study** but not divinely inspired Scripture (not in Hebrew canon).

All4Yah **does not take a position** on inspiration. We provide the manuscripts, provenance data, and historical context so you can make an informed decision based on your faith tradition.

### Q2: Why are Tier 2 books in Greek, not Hebrew?

**Answer:** Most Tier 2 books were originally written in Hebrew or Aramaic, but the Hebrew originals were **lost**. We have:

- **Greek translations** (LXX Septuagint, 3rd-1st c. BCE)
- **Hebrew fragments** for some books (Sirach, Tobit, Psalm 151 in Dead Sea Scrolls)
- **Syriac and Latin translations** (Peshitta, Vulgate)

The **LXX Greek** is our primary source because it was:
- The Bible of the early Christian church
- Quoted 300+ times in the New Testament
- Preserved in complete form (Hebrew originals mostly lost)

### Q3: Can I trust Tier 2 manuscripts?

**Answer:** Yes, with **high confidence** (0.75-0.95 provenance scores).

Tier 2 manuscripts are attested in:
- **Codex Vaticanus** (4th c. CE) - one of the oldest complete Bibles
- **Codex Sinaiticus** (4th c. CE) - discovered at St. Catherine's Monastery
- **Codex Alexandrinus** (5th c. CE) - complete LXX with deuterocanon
- **Dead Sea Scrolls** (3rd c. BCE - 1st c. CE) - Hebrew fragments of Sirach, Tobit, Psalm 151

The manuscript quality is **comparable to Tier 1 Greek NT manuscripts**.

### Q4: Why does John 10:22 mention Hanukkah if Maccabees isn't canonical to Protestants?

**Answer:** This is a **historical reference**, not a doctrinal endorsement.

- **John 10:22:** "Then came the Festival of Dedication at Jerusalem. It was winter."
- **Hanukkah origin:** 1 Maccabees 4:52-59 (rededication of Temple after Maccabean revolt, 164 BCE)

Jesus observed Hanukkah as a Jewish cultural festival, just as modern Christians observe Thanksgiving (not biblical). The NT reference **does not require** 1 Maccabees to be canonical ‚Äî it simply records a historical event.

However, this cross-reference shows the **value of Tier 2 books for understanding NT context**.

### Q5: What is provenance confidence, and how is it calculated?

**Answer:** Provenance confidence is a **scholarly credibility score** (0.0-1.0) based on:

1. **Manuscript age and quantity** (more ancient copies = higher score)
2. **Textual stability** (fewer variants between manuscripts = higher score)
3. **Early church usage** (quoted by church fathers = higher score)
4. **Archaeological evidence** (Dead Sea Scrolls fragments = higher score)
5. **Scholarly consensus** (widely accepted = higher score)

**Example:**
- **Sirach: 0.95** (Hebrew fragments from Cairo Genizah, Masada, DSS; LXX Greek codices)
- **2 Esdras: 0.75** (Latin Vulgate only, not in LXX or Hebrew)

See [Provenance Confidence Score Documentation](PROVENANCE_CONFIDENCE_SCORES.md) for detailed methodology.

### Q6: Can I study Tier 3 books safely?

**Answer:** Yes, for **historical study**, not for doctrine.

Tier 3 books (Gospel of Thomas, Gospel of Mary) are:
- ‚ùå **Not recognized as Scripture** by any major Christian tradition
- ‚ùå **Gnostic theology** contradicts orthodox Christianity
- ‚úÖ **Valuable for history** ‚Äî understanding early Christian diversity

**Use Tier 3 books to:**
- Study the context of canonical gospel formation
- Understand early heresies the church fathers opposed
- Research 2nd-century Christian thought

**Do NOT use Tier 3 books to:**
- Establish doctrine
- Replace or reinterpret canonical Gospels
- Claim "hidden teachings" of Jesus
