# Test UI/UX with Playwright

Launch the development server and use Playwright MCP to visually test the manuscript viewer.

## Testing Workflow:

1. Start the dev server:
   - Run `npm start` in background
   - Wait for compilation to complete

2. Navigate to the manuscripts page:
   - Use Playwright to visit `http://localhost:3000/manuscripts`
   - Take screenshot of initial state

3. Test sample verse selection:
   - Click each of the 8 sample verse buttons
   - Verify manuscripts load for each verse
   - Take screenshots of key verses (Genesis 2:4, Psalm 23:1, Matthew 1:21, John 3:16)

4. Test restoration toggle:
   - Click the restoration toggle button
   - Verify text changes from restored to original
