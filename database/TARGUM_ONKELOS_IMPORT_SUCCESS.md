## Historical Significance

### What is a Targum?

**Targum** (תרגום) = "translation" or "interpretation" in Hebrew/Aramaic

**Historical Context:**
- After the Babylonian Exile (586 BCE), Aramaic gradually replaced Hebrew as the spoken language of Jewish communities
- By the Second Temple period (516 BCE - 70 CE), most Jews spoke Aramaic, not Hebrew
- Synagogue worship required oral Aramaic translation (Targum) of the Hebrew Torah readings
- Originally oral traditions, later written down and standardized

### Targum Onkelos - The Authoritative Translation

**Compiler:** Traditionally attributed to Onkelos the Proselyte (תרגום אונקלוס), a contemporary of Rabban Gamaliel II (c. 90-110 CE)
**Alternative Theory:** Named after Aquila of Sinope (Ἀκύλας), Greek translator, with confusion between Greek/Aramaic traditions
**Date:** 1st-4th century CE (standardized by Babylonian academies)
**Region:** Babylonia (modern Iraq), later adopted universally

**Why It Matters:**

1. **Official Status**
   - Recognized as the authoritative Aramaic Targum by both Babylonian and Palestinian Jewish communities
   - Required reading alongside Hebrew Torah in traditional synagogue worship
   - Babylonian Talmud mandates: "One should complete one's weekly Torah portions, twice in Hebrew and once in Targum" (Berachot 8a)

2. **Literal Translation Philosophy**
   - Most literal of all Targums (compared to Targum Pseudo-Jonathan, Targum Neofiti)
   - Stays close to Hebrew Masoretic Text word order
   - Minimal expansions or theological interpretations (compared to Palestinian Targums)

3. **Divine Name Preservation**
   - Retains יהוה (YHWH) in Hebrew script even within Aramaic text
   - Shows Jewish reverence for the Tetragrammaton
   - Contrasts with Septuagint which substitutes κύριος (Kyrios/Lord)

4. **Theological Circumlocutions**
   - Uses "Memra" (מימרא, "Word") for divine manifestations
   - Uses "Shekhinah" (שכינתא, "Dwelling/Presence") for God's presence
   - Avoids anthropomorphisms (e.g., "God's hand" → "God's power")

5. **Textual Witness**
   - Witnesses to a Hebrew text similar to the Masoretic Text (MT)
   - Occasionally preserves alternate readings from pre-Masoretic traditions
   - Valuable for textual criticism of the Hebrew Bible

## Sample Verses

### Genesis 1:1 - Creation in Aramaic
**Aramaic (Targum Onkelos):**
> [Data not retrieved in query - to be added]

**Hebrew (WLC):**
> בְּרֵאשִׁית בָּרָא אֱלֹהִים אֵת הַשָּׁמַיִם וְאֵת הָאָרֶץ

**English Translation:**
> In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth.

### Exodus 3:14 - Divine Name Revelation (Ehyeh Asher Ehyeh)
**Aramaic (Targum Onkelos):**
> וַאֲמַר יְיָ לְמשֶׁה אֶהְיֶה אֲשֶׁר אֶהְיֶה וַאֲמַר כִּדְנַן תֵּימַר לִבְנֵי יִשְׂרָאֵל אֶהְיֶה שַׁלְחַנִי לְוָתְכוֹן

**Transliteration:**
> Va'amar YHVH l'Moshe, Ehyeh asher Ehyeh. Va'amar kidnan teimar livnei Yisrael: Ehyeh shalchani l'vatchon.

**Hebrew (WLC):**
> וַיֹּאמֶר אֱלֹהִים אֶל־מֹשֶׁה אֶהְיֶה אֲשֶׁר אֶהְיֶה וַיֹּאמֶר כֹּה תֹאמַר לִבְנֵי יִשְׂרָאֵל אֶהְיֶה שְׁלָחַנִי אֲלֵיכֶם

**English Translation:**
> And YHVH said to Moses, "I AM WHO I AM (Ehyeh Asher Ehyeh)." And He said, "Thus you shall say to the children of Israel: 'I AM (Ehyeh) has sent me to you.'"

**Note:** Targum Onkelos preserves the divine name יְיָ (YHVH) in Hebrew script and keeps "Ehyeh Asher Ehyeh" (אֶהְיֶה אֲשֶׁר אֶהְיֶה) untranslated, showing reverence for God's self-revelation.

### Exodus 3:15 - The Name Forever
**Aramaic (Targum Onkelos):**
> וַאֲמַר עוֹד יְיָ לְמשֶׁה כִּדְנַן תֵּימַר לִבְנֵי יִשְׂרָאֵל יְיָ אֱלָהָא דְאַבְהַתְכוֹן אֱלָהֵהּ דְאַבְרָהָם אֱלָהֵהּ דְיִצְחָק וֵאלָהֵהּ דְיַעֲקֹב שַׁלְחַנִי לְוָתְכוֹן דֵין שְׁמִי לְעָלַם וְדֵין דָכְרָנִי לְכָל דָר וְדָר

**Transliteration:**
> Va'amar od YHVH l'Moshe kidnan teimar livnei Yisrael: YHVH Elaha d'avhatkon, Elaheh d'Avraham, Elaheh d'Yitzchak, ve'Elaheh d'Ya'akov shalchani l'vatchon. Dein shmi l'alam v'dein dochrani l'chol dar v'dar.

**Hebrew (WLC):**
> וַיֹּאמֶר עוֹד אֱלֹהִים אֶל־מֹשֶׁה כֹּה־תֹאמַר אֶל־בְּנֵי יִשְׂרָאֵל יְהוָה אֱלֹהֵי אֲבֹתֵיכֶם אֱלֹהֵי אַבְרָהָם אֱלֹהֵי יִצְחָק וֵאלֹהֵי יַעֲקֹב שְׁלָחַנִי אֲלֵיכֶם זֶה־שְּׁמִי לְעֹלָם וְזֶה זִכְרִי לְדֹר דֹּר

**English Translation:**
> And YHVH said further to Moses, "Thus you shall say to the children of Israel: 'YHVH, the God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, has sent me to you. This is My name forever, and this is My memorial to all generations.'"

**Key Feature:** The divine name יְיָ (YHVH) appears **twice** in this verse in Hebrew script, embedded within the Aramaic translation, showing the Targum's refusal to translate the Tetragrammaton.

### Deuteronomy 6:4 - The Shema in Aramaic
**Aramaic (Targum Onkelos):**
> שְׁמַע יִשְׂרָאֵל יְיָ אֱלָהָנָא יְיָ חָד

**Transliteration:**
> Shema Yisrael, YHVH Elahana, YHVH chad.

**Hebrew (WLC):**
> שְׁמַע יִשְׂרָאֵל יְהוָה אֱלֹהֵינוּ יְהוָה אֶחָד

**English Translation:**
> Hear, O Israel: YHVH our God, YHVH is one.

**Note:** The most important prayer in Judaism, translated into Aramaic for daily recitation. The divine name יְיָ (YHVH) appears **twice**, untranslated, showing the centrality of God's revealed name.

### Numbers 6:24-26 - Priestly Blessing with Shekhinah
**Numbers 6:24 (Aramaic):**
> יְבָרְכִנָּךְ יְיָ וְיִטְּרִנָּךְ

**English:** May YHVH bless you and keep you.

**Numbers 6:25 (Aramaic):**
> יַנְהַר יְיָ **שְׁכִנְתֵּיהּ** לְוָתָךְ וִירַחֵם יָתָךְ

**Transliteration:** Yanhar YHVH **Shekhinteih** l'vatach virachem yatach.

**English Translation:** May YHVH make His **Shekhinah** (Divine Presence) shine upon you and be gracious to you.

**Theological Note:** The Hebrew "may YHVH make His face shine" (יָאֵר יְהוָה פָּנָיו) is rendered as "may YHVH cause His **Shekhinah** to shine" to avoid anthropomorphism (God having a "face"). This shows Targum Onkelos' theological interpretation while maintaining reverence.

**Numbers 6:26 (Aramaic):**
> יִסַּב יְיָ אַפֵּיהּ לְוָתָךְ וִישַׁוֵּי לָךְ שְׁלָם

**English:** May YHVH lift up His face toward you and give you peace.

## Theological Features

### 1. Divine Name Preservation (יְיָ - YHVH)

**Unique Practice:** Targum Onkelos writes the divine name יְיָ (YHVH) in **Hebrew square script** within the Aramaic text, refusing to translate it.

**Examples:**
- Exodus 3:14: וַאֲמַר **יְיָ** לְמשֶׁה
- Exodus 3:15: וַאֲמַר עוֹד **יְיָ** לְמשֶׁה
- Deuteronomy 6:4: שְׁמַע יִשְׂרָאֵל **יְיָ** אֱלָהָנָא **יְיָ** חָד

**Significance:**
- Shows Jewish reverence for the Tetragrammaton (4-letter divine name)
- Contrasts with Septuagint (LXX) which substitutes κύριος (Kyrios/Lord)
- Contrasts with later Christian tradition of using "LORD" in capital letters
- All4Yah's restoration to "Yahuah" aligns with preserving the original divine name

### 2. Memra (מימרא - "The Word")

**Theological Circumlocution:** When Hebrew describes God acting directly, Targum Onkelos often uses "Memra of YHVH" (Word of YHVH) to maintain divine transcendence.

**Examples:**
- Genesis 15:6: "Abraham believed in **the Memra of YHVH**" (Hebrew: "believed in YHVH")
- Exodus 19:17: "Moses brought the people out to meet **the Memra of Elohim**"

**Theological Purpose:**
- Avoids depicting God as physically present or active
- Introduces mediating concept between transcendent God and physical world
- Some scholars see connection to Greek "Logos" (Word) in John 1:1

### 3. Shekhinah (שְׁכִנְתָּא - "Divine Presence")

**Theological Circumlocution:** When Hebrew describes God "dwelling" or His "presence," Targum uses "Shekhinah."

**Examples:**
- Exodus 25:8: "Let them make Me a sanctuary that My **Shekhinah** may dwell among them"
- Numbers 6:25: "May YHVH make His **Shekhinah** shine upon you"

**Theological Purpose:**
- Avoids anthropomorphism (God having a physical body or location)
- Emphasizes God's immanent presence while maintaining transcendence
- Foundation for later Kabbalistic concept of "Shekhinah" as feminine divine presence

### 4. Anthropomorphism Avoidance

Targum Onkelos systematically avoids attributing human characteristics to God:

| Hebrew (Anthropomorphism) | Targum Onkelos (Circumlocution) |
|---------------------------|----------------------------------|
| "Hand of God" | "Power of God" |
| "Face of God" | "Presence of God" / "Shekhinah" |
| "Eyes of God" | "God sees" (verb, not noun) |
| "God came down" | "God revealed Himself" |
| "God repented" | "God changed His decree" |

**Theological Motivation:** Protect Jewish monotheism from pagan anthropomorphic concepts while maintaining biblical narrative.

## All4Yah Integration

### Divine Name Restoration Across Languages

Targum Onkelos provides a **bridge language** between Hebrew and Greek, showing how the divine name was handled in the 1st-4th centuries CE:

| Language | Text | Divine Name | All4Yah Restoration |
|----------|------|-------------|---------------------|
| **Hebrew (WLC)** | Original | **יְהוָה (YHWH)** | **Yahuah** |
| **Aramaic (Onkelos)** | Translation | **יְיָ (YY) - preserved in Hebrew** | **Yahuah** |
| **Greek (LXX)** | Translation | **κύριος (Kyrios)** = Lord | **Yahuah** |
| **Greek (NT)** | New Testament | **κύριος (Kyrios)** in OT quotes | **Yahuah** |
| **Latin (Vulgate)** | Translation | **Dominus** = Lord | **Yahuah** |
| **English (WEB)** | Translation | **LORD** (capital letters) | **Yahuah** |

**Key Insight:** Targum Onkelos shows that Jewish communities in the 1st-4th centuries CE **preserved the written form of YHWH** even when reading it aloud as "Adonai" (Lord). This supports All4Yah's mission to restore the divine name across all language traditions.

## Historical Context

### Why Aramaic?

**Language Shift Timeline:**
- **1000-586 BCE** - Hebrew is the spoken language of Israel/Judah
- **586 BCE** - Babylonian Exile begins; Jews deported to Babylon (Aramaic-speaking region)
- **539 BCE** - Persian conquest; Aramaic becomes official language of Persian Empire
- **516 BCE** - Return from exile; many Jews now speak Aramaic, not Hebrew
- **200 BCE - 200 CE** - Hebrew becomes primarily a liturgical language; Aramaic is vernacular
- **70 CE** - Temple destruction; diaspora accelerates Aramaic use

**Result:** By the time of Jesus (1st century CE), most Palestinian Jews spoke Aramaic. Hebrew was read in synagogue, but required oral Aramaic translation for comprehension.

### Synagogue Practice

**Traditional Synagogue Liturgy:**
1. **Hebrew Torah reading** - Read from the scroll
2. **Aramaic Targum recitation** - Verse-by-verse translation
3. **Congregation understanding** - Aramaic was the spoken language

**Talmudic Regulation (Megillah 3a):**
- Reader must not read more than one verse before the translator (meturgeman) translates
- Prevents congregation from losing comprehension
- Translator must NOT read from written text (oral tradition)
- Later, written Targums standardized for study

### Relationship to New Testament

**Aramaic Context:**
- Jesus spoke Aramaic (e.g., "Talitha koum" - Mark 5:41, "Eli, Eli, lema sabachthani" - Matthew 27:46)
- Early Jewish Christians used Targums alongside Hebrew Scripture
- Targum Onkelos provides linguistic/theological background for understanding NT

**Example Connections:**
- **John 1:1** - "In the beginning was the Word (Λόγος/Logos)" echoes Targum's "Memra" (Word)
- **John 1:14** - "The Word became flesh and dwelt (ἐσκήνωσεν/eskēnōsen) among us" echoes "Shekhinah" (Divine Dwelling)

## Textual Comparison

### Targum Onkelos vs. Hebrew Masoretic Text

**General Alignment:**
- Targum Onkelos closely follows the Masoretic Text (MT)
- Word order generally preserved
- Minimal expansions compared to Palestinian Targums (Pseudo-Jonathan, Neofiti)

**Occasional Variants:**
- Some readings reflect pre-Masoretic Hebrew text traditions
- Valuable for textual criticism
- Dead Sea Scrolls occasionally support Targum readings over MT

**Example (Genesis 4:8):**
- **MT (shorter):** "Cain spoke to Abel his brother. And it happened when they were in the field..."
- **Targum Onkelos (longer):** "Cain said to Abel his brother, '**Come, let us go out to the field.**' And it happened when they were in the field..."
- **Support:** Septuagint, Samaritan Pentateuch, Syriac Peshitta all include the longer reading
- **Conclusion:** Targum preserves an earlier Hebrew tradition lost in MT

## Conclusion

The Targum Onkelos import represents a **major milestone** for All4Yah's mission of textual transparency and divine name restoration. With 5,839 verses of Aramaic Torah from the 1st-4th centuries CE, users can now:

- **Study the Torah in the language Jesus spoke** (Aramaic)
- **See how Jewish communities preserved the divine name** (יְיָ in Hebrew script)
- **Understand theological interpretations** (Memra, Shekhinah) that shaped Judaism
- **Compare literal Aramaic translation** with Hebrew original and Greek LXX
- **Trace the divine name** across 3 languages: Hebrew יְהוָה → Aramaic יְיָ → All4Yah **Yahuah**

**Mission Alignment:** "Restoring truth, one name at a time" - Targum Onkelos shows that Jewish scribes **refused to translate the divine name YHVH** even when translating into Aramaic. They wrote יְיָ in Hebrew script within the Aramaic text, preserving God's revealed name. All4Yah continues this tradition by restoring **Yahuah** (the pronunciation of יהוה) across all manuscripts and languages.

This manuscript stands as a **witness from the Second Temple and Rabbinic periods**, showing how Jewish communities maintained reverence for the divine name while making Scripture accessible in the common language of the people.
